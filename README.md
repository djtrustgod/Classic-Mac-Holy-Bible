# Classic Mac Holy Bible (Filemaker)

The Classic Mac Holy Bible provides a full-text searchable Holy Bible application for the classic Macintoshes that can run on System 6 to MacOS 9, from a Mac Plus 68K to a PowerMac G4 even running OS X with the Classic Environment.  The Bible can operate as a stand-alone classic Mac application and or has a FileMaker database for those who wish to fork and improve the source, or create versions for other classic operating systems.

This basic framework could be used to create a fully searchable classic Macintosh application for any other type of large document that is structured in a similar manner. It would be fairly easy to create versions for other document translations or editions.

This project is also available on [Macintosh Garden](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/classic-mac-holy-bible-filemaker)

## Prerequisites

System 6.0.8 or later, Mac Plus or later, 4MB RAM, 20MB storage free
(Note: For 4MB Classic Macs, it's recommended you run System 6.0.8, disable multifinder, and run minimal extensions to free as much memory as possible, as the application needs 3MB to run)
