# Classic Mac Holy Bible (Filemaker)

The Classic Mac Holy Bible provides a full-text searchable Holy Bible application for the classic Macintoshes that can run on System 6 to System 9.  While the Bible can operate as a stand-alone application, it is built in Filemaker 3, and can run on any computer with Filemaker installed.  As such, the Filemaker format is included for those who wish to fork and improve the source, or create runtime versions for other operating systems.
