# Classic Mac Holy Bible (Filemaker)

The Classic Mac Holy Bible provides a full-text searchable Holy Bible application for the classic Macintoshes that can run on System 6 to System 9, or even OS X with the Classic Environment.  The Bible can operate as a stand-alone classic Mac application via the [Filemaker 3 runtime here](https://github.com/djtrustgod/Classic-Mac-Holy-Bible/tree/main/ClassicMac/Runtime). Also the full source [Filemaker source database is here](https://github.com/djtrustgod/Classic-Mac-Holy-Bible/tree/main/ClassicMac/Source) for those who wish to fork and improve the source, or create versions for other classic operating systems.
